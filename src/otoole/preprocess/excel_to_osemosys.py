"""Extract data from spreadsheets and write to an OSeMOSYS datafile

Reads and writes the following OSeMOSYS parameters and sets to and from
files on disk.

Notes
=====

Sets
----
These are the standard sets::

    set YEAR;
    set TECHNOLOGY;
    set TIMESLICE;
    set FUEL;
    set EMISSION;
    set MODE_OF_OPERATION;
    set REGION;
    set SEASON;
    set DAYTYPE;
    set DAILYTIMEBRACKET;
    set FLEXIBLEDEMANDTYPE;
    set STORAGE;

All sets are written in a CSV file in one column of values with header of ``VALUE``.
For example, the CSV file for set YEAR::

    VALUE
    2015
    2016
    2017
    2018
    2019
    2020

Sets are written into the OSeMOSYS data file using the following syntax::

    set YEAR := 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 ;


Parameters
----------
In general, parameters can be written into CSV files in narrow or wide
formats. In narrow format, the CSV file should look as follows::

    REGION,TIMESLICE,YEAR,VALUE
    SIMPLICITY,ID,2014,0.1667
    SIMPLICITY,IN,2014,0.0833
    SIMPLICITY,SD,2014,0.1667
    SIMPLICITY,SN,2014,0.0833
    SIMPLICITY,WD,2014,0.3333
    SIMPLICITY,WN,2014,0.1667


In wide format, the final index is transposed::

    REGION,TIMESLICE,2014,2015,...
    SIMPLICITY,ID,0.1667,0.1667
    SIMPLICITY,IN,0.0833,0.0833
    SIMPLICITY,SD,0.1667,0.1667
    SIMPLICITY,SN,0.0833,0.0833
    SIMPLICITY,WD,0.3333,0.3333
    SIMPLICITY,WN,0.1667,0.1667

Wide format is a bit nicer to use with spreadsheets,
as it allows you to more easily plot graphs of values, but narrow
format is a more flexible and easily manipulated data format.

Writing parameteters:

1-dimensional e.g. DiscountRate{r in REGION}
